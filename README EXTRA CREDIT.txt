We chose to implement the slider as well as the layers extra credits. For the slider, the vast majority of the changes were concentrated in the EditorView and Controller Files. These changes were not too complicated, we only added a JSlider, that would follow the tick as the animation progressed and change it when dragged. The most complicated part was adding a ChangeListener to the slider.
For the layers, the majority of the changes are clustered in the animation builder, animation model, and the editor view. We had to modify the way the animation builder makes models to allow for the creation of layers. Our solution was to have a hashmap which mapped each layer to a specific hashmap of shapes for that layer. This way we could separate the shapes into "chunks" which could be rendered in numerical order, regardless of the order they were added. The editor View and controller changes were all related to adding the editing functionality for layers. This was accomplished by adding a button labeled "Layer Manager", with a dropdown allowing the user to pick from four options.
